Here should be a **short and catchy** introduction on what you are writing
about. Provide some information which **insists** the user to read the full
blog post.

## Then start with a heading

This is where the content resides. Some things that should be kept in mind
before writing any post for our club i.e. **GNU/Linux Users' Group**, **NIT
Durgapur**:

* Keep it *simple*, *clean* and well *highlighted*.
* Always explain any snippet of code or image that you provide.
* Do not add sub headings. Use onlyÂ `##` or `h2` for a heading.

Below is a sample code written in C:
```c
int main() {
  return 0;
}
```
Above is the **simplest program** that you can write in C. It is defining the `main`
function which is the one function that you should always define while writing a
program. Then we return the value `0` to the environment from where this program
is executed.
