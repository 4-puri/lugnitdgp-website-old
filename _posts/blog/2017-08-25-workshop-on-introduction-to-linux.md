**LINUX** is the
most frequently heard FOSS buzzword in the mass media today. However, because
of its common usage and certain misconceptions that beginners possess, the definition
of the term Linux has expanded. Considering that Linux is used by many tech giants, it was our clubs responsibility to promote its usage among different kinds of students, especially for newbies.

The workshop started off with the definition of GNU/Linux
clearing the biggest misconception of Linux being an operating system. Linux is
kernel which is useless in absence of an operating system! The interesting
origin of Linux also piqued the interest of the attendees. How **Richard
Stallman**, the software freedom activist and programmer, launched the GNU
project to get an OS comprising entirely of free software. What student
wouldn’t be able to relate to the importance of free things?

The advantages of 
Linux over the conventionally used OS were also brought to light in the
workshop, the major pro being that it’s **free**!! Apart from that Linux is also
secure, customisable and powerful and after all which self respecting
developer/coder wouldn’t want their computer screen to look like this.

Who can forget the biggest pro of them all: **no antivirus
required**! So with Linux in your hands, you can forget about the annoying
antivirus updates and browse any file without fear.

The workshop discussed the how easy it is to customize different programs in Linux. It gives you the option of customizing distributions or *distros*, environments, window manager and themes according to your
convenience! Linux distros which are basically OS based on a Linux kernel and
package management systems were discussed in abundance. **Variety is the spice of
life and Linux firmly believes that**. It provides us with a list of *distros* to
choose from as per our convenience:

and gives us a list as big as that of cinnamon ice cream toppings
of the desktop environments for the *distros* (Mint users might get this one) like
**GNOME**, **KDE**, **XFCE**, **Pantheon**, etc.

Apart from the innumerable choices, the workshop talked
about how Linux **gives us power**. What take us an eternity to install in Windows,
can be done with in Linux by typing about four odd words in the ***terminal***. The
workshop also gave the attendees a brief understanding of which *distro* would be
right for them and well if one *distro* doesn’t sit right with them, they can
always go for another one.

The workshop was a success as it sparked an
interest in the attendees to discover the power of Linux. The fact that they
have a chance to contribute to and solve the issues they encounter in Linux, on
their own is what gave the developer’s the drive to delve into the world of
open source and make a few tweaks not only to the code but also to their
personas. I
could end with an ICMP joke but it would probably be repetitive, so happy
reading and happy coding!!
