We at GNU/Linux Users' Group are always open to tech enthusiasts like ourselves! You can become one of us in the following ways:

1. You are welcome to try for the auditions of the club which are conducted once a year.
2. A spot in the club is waiting for anyone who is a GSoCer or a major open-source contributor.
3. The volunteers in our activities and ventures and the avid contributors to our projects will gradually be absorbed into the club.
4. Students from other colleges can become a part of us as a representative of our club in their college.
