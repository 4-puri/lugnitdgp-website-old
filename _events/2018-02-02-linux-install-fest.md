What’s common between Twitter, Google, NASA, Amazon , McDonald’s and RaspberryPi ? Well, a geek would easily answer that question. Yes, Linux. This absolutely free open sourced OS comes with the most amicable and gigantic community, and the key to let you twist the OS in your own way. 

So,gear up. GNU\/Linux Users’ Group Of NIT Durgapur brings to you the Linux Installation Fest. Come enter the world of open source and let your imagination let loose. 

**PS**: Highly recommended for CS\/IT students as Linux is the OS that the college asks you to work on 2nd year onwards.
