"Amazon is here". And the chase starts. Extra study hours. Longer CVs. More cutoff. More of many more things but we aren't talking of those now. Well, GLUG says, "Amazon sachme aane wala hai". Surprising, ain't it ?
All the way from Seattle, GLUG brings for NITDGPians "AmazonTalks", a Facebook Live Session with 2 of the GLUG Alumni who own significant pages in the Amazon book today. Their talk on open source and tech will surely enthrall you and clear your doubts. And if that's enough, wait for the AMA session right after their talk. 
No DM Sen this time. Your own room. 3rd of September, 11 am.
