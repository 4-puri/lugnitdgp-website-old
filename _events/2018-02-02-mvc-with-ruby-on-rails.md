Competitive coding is now a thing in our campus. TLE, AC, WA are some of the most commonly used terms now. Having talked of it, we are reminded of CodeCracker, the college's very own Online Judge. Such an amazing thing it is, ain't it ? Did you ever wish to contribute to it's betterment or even develop a similar thing ? Have you ever wondered what platform is it built on ? Ruby on Rails aka RoR. 
Well, GLUG, aware of the need of RoR in the 'techavaganza' we all experience today, present a Techtalk on "MVC with RoR". Be there at DM Sen Auditorium on 29th August 2017.
